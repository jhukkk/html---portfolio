<h1>The Best Movies According to Khulan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Malcolm & Marie</h3>
<p>The argument between the characters and the logical reasoning of those is really interesting to watch.</p>
<h3>Sing 2</h3>
<p>This animation is one of the best feel-good yet motivating movies in my opinion.</p>
<h3>Marvel movie series</h3>
<p>I am a Marvel fan myself that watching these movies become a great comfort, motivator, and hilarious scenes to me.</p>
